# JSSE - JavaScript Engine in Rust

## Project Overview
A from-scratch JavaScript engine implemented in Rust. No JS parser/engine libraries allowed as dependencies — every detail must be implemented by us. Utility crates (parsing combinators, math, etc.) are fine.

**Ultimate goal: 100% test262 pass rate.**

## Repository Layout
- `spec/` — ECMAScript spec submodule (tc39/ecma262). **NEVER modify.**
- `test262/` — Test suite submodule (tc39/test262). **NEVER modify.**
- `tests/` — Custom tests that don't fit test262.

## Key Rules
1. **Never modify** files in `spec/` or `test262/` submodules.
2. No importing a JS parser or engine crate. Implement everything from scratch.
3. Dependencies for parsing utilities, math, etc. are allowed.
4. When implementing a feature, identify relevant test262 tests to validate against.
5. After running test262, update `README.md` with pass count and percentage.
6. The spec is the ultimate source of truth with respect to JavaScript. Use it to determine the syntax and semantics of operations.

## Testing
- Primary validation: test262 suite
- Custom tests: `tests/` directory
- After any implementation work, run the full test262 suite and update README.md progress.
- Run test262: `uv run python scripts/run-test262.py`
- Run linter: `./scripts/lint.sh`
- Python scripts are run via `uv run python` (no virtualenv setup needed).
- Ensure forward progress. 
  - We should implement new features to ensure new tests pass without regressing on previously passing tests.
