# jsse

An agent-coded JS engine in Rust. I didn't touch a single line of code here. Not one. This repo is a write-only data store. I didn't even create this repo by hand -- my agent did that.

**Goal: 100% test262 pass rate.**

## Test262 Progress

| Total Tests | Passing | Failing | Pass Rate |
|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| 0           | 0       | 0       | 0%        |

*No tests have been run yet. The engine is not yet implemented.*

## Structure
